# Selenium-Script-Project

Required knowledge:


• Programming, data structures and algorithms.
• C, C++, Java, Python.
• Operating systems, threads, graphical interfaces.
objection
• Creation of a Python programming environment that can be replicated on other PCs.
• Demonstrating the use of Python libraries in new and creative ways.
• Demonstrating the candidate's programming knowledge, using the Python environment.
Evaluation criteria
• Handling errors, recording execution steps, documenting the environment
• Collaboration with colleagues, questions put to our engineers
The proposed theme



1. THE ENVIRONMENT
Install Python 3, then Selenium Python API to explore web pages. Also installed
numpy, opencv, pyautogui and pyaudio.
Write down in a TXT or DOC file the steps from installing the libraries, the operating system under which
runs, the errors encountered, and the steps taken to overcome them.
2. APPLICATION
Create a Python script that uses the Selenium Python API to browse YouTube and
play some video.
In parallel, the script will record on the desktop (video + audio). (Registration should take a maximum of 2 minutes)
After the 2 minutes, analyze the audio part and write the sound level in db in a file
that video.
CAREFUL
The application (script) must manage the problems that may appear - popups, errors, lack of network, etc
- and write down in a log file the steps he takes, including when dealing with situations
unforeseen.
3. PRESENTATION
The code must be placed on a public github or gitlab repository. You have two weeks at your disposal
to send the description of the environment installation, and of the scripts.

Very essential to the project is the code to be thoroughly explained and commnented, frequent commits to show the progress. Careful made documentation  with the packages/libraries and errors encountered and how I solved them is also important for the project.
